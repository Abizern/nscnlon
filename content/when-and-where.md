The next event is on **Tuesday, 21st August, 2018**

## When
We meet on the third Tuesday of the month at around 7pm in a pub near Waterloo, Waterloo East and Southwark. It' a modern pub that does really nice sourdough pizza.

I have a table reserved from 6:30 usually at the back right, by the windows. Just look for the menu on the table that has my name, Abizer, written on it that marks the reservation.
