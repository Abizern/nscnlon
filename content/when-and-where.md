## March event is cancelled

More of a precaution than anything else. 

The next event is on *Tuesday, 21st April, 2020*.


## When
We usually meet on the third Tuesday of the month at around 6.45pm in a the Fountain & Ink pub conveniently located close to Waterloo, Waterloo East and Southwark stations. It' a modern place that does really nice sourdough pizza. Other items are available. There is also a good selection of beers.

I have a table reserved from 6:30 usually at the back right, by the windows. Just look for the menu on the table that has my name, Abizer, written on it that marks the reservation.
