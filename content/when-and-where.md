## May will be a virtual event

The next event is on *Tuesday, 19th May, 2020*.

It's probably best to continue with social distancing for the May event.

The April event when surprisingly well over Group FaceTime. Connection and video was stable, it was easy to have conversation.

Closer to the time I'll collect iMessage addresses for those of you that want to attend and on the day I'll set up a group FaceTime and invite any of you who want to participate.

I don't think this will be a regular format. I enjoy meeting you in person and we'll have to supply our own food and beverages. But something is better than nothing.


## When 
We usually meet on the third Tuesday of the month at around 6.45pm.

## Where (Post Lockdown)
 The Fountain & Ink pub conveniently located close to Waterloo, Waterloo East and Southwark stations. It' a modern place that does really nice sourdough pizza. Other items are available. There is also a good selection of beers.
 
I have a table reserved from 6:30 usually at the back right, by the windows. Just look for the menu on the table that has my name, Abizer, written on it that marks the reservation.
