## When {#when}

We usually meet on the third Tuesday of the month from around 6:45pm.


## Where {#where}

Since the Pandemic we've been meeting over Group Facetime. We have met a couple of times since at a pub near Waterloo, but we'll stick to remote meetings until I can find a more convenient place to meet.

If you contact me, I'll add you to the Facetime group.
