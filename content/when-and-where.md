## April will be a virtual event

The next event is on *Tuesday, 21st April, 2020*.

We don't know whether the guidelines will be changed for social distancing in a month, but we can plan for that from now.

The most we've ever had at an NSCoder Night in London has been around 22-24 people. Group FaceTime can handle 32. So, if we can't, or shouldn't meet in person I'm planning on the April event being virtual.

Closer to the time I'll collect iMessage addresses for those of you that want to attend and on the day I'll set up a group FaceTime and invite any of you who want to participate.

I don't think this will be a regular format. I enjoy meeting you in person and we'll have to supply our own food and beverages. But something is better than nothing.


## When
We usually meet on the third Tuesday of the month at around 6.45pm in a the Fountain & Ink pub conveniently located close to Waterloo, Waterloo East and Southwark stations. It' a modern place that does really nice sourdough pizza. Other items are available. There is also a good selection of beers.

I have a table reserved from 6:30 usually at the back right, by the windows. Just look for the menu on the table that has my name, Abizer, written on it that marks the reservation.
