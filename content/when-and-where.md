The next event is on **Tuesday, 18th September, 2018**

## When
We meet on the third Tuesday of the month at around 7pm in a pub near Waterloo, Waterloo East and Southwark. It' a modern pub that does really nice sourdough pizza.

September 2018 Marks 9 years of NSCoderNight London. 108 get togethers. The people have changed over the years, as has the venue and the focus of conversation. But the idea of Mac and iOS developers getting together to talk about what is on their mind has been a constant over the years.

Unfortunately, this month sees a presentation based event happening on the same night - [iOS London](https://www.meetup.com/ioslondon/events/252741052/). I know people have different time constraints and expectations of what they get from a meetup, so go to whichever one best suits your needs. I'll be at the Fountain and Ink, and I look forward to seeing you there as well.

I have a table reserved from 6:30 usually at the back right, by the windows. Just look for the menu on the table that has my name, Abizer, written on it that marks the reservation.
