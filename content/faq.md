#### What is this about?
This is a chance for people with a common interest to get together. As long as you have an interest in programming for Apple devices then you share a common interest. So come along!

#### What happens?
Whatever you feel comfortable with. Sometimes somebody brings out a laptop or device to show off something cool, or to ask for advice about a bug. Or people just talk about things the way that you normally would with friends in a social setting.

#### Who Turns up?
All sorts. Independent software developers, Contractors, full- and part-time Cocoa(-Touch) developers, students. People writing Java in their day jobs, but are interested in writing software for Apple devices.

#### I'm not from London. Can I still turn up?
We have had regulars coming from Poole, Reading and Brighton. We've had drop-ins from the States and Sweden and Ukraine. If you can make it to London, or you are in London on the day feel free to just show up.

#### How will I find you?
Look for the group of people that has a higher than average count of Apple devices. Or, ask for my telephone number and give me a call when you get there. This is not a big pub so if you can’t see us you’re either early or in the wrong place. Or ping me on Twitter (@abizern). There is a contact page in this site

#### I'm just learning programming, is this too advanced for me?
No. A lot of people are just chatting, but if you have a question to ask; you'll find people generally willing to explain things to you. Sometimes in more detail than you want; but that's not always a bad thing.
